## Project Overview
The aim of this project is to build an end-to-end system that recommends stocks to buy or sell every day.

# Intermediate Remarks
While the above scope is still largely WIP, the repo that has been uploaded here covers one small part in this workflow - from data collection to the training of a model for labelling articles as "news" or not (An article is a piece of news if it covers or is directly related to an event that is relevant to the stock concerned)

The rest of the project will be uploaded in due time.

# Guidance
To run the above intermediate flow, simply run the EDA.ipynb and the data_processing_main.py files.
