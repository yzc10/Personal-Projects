# Personal-Projects
##  Introduction
This repository is a collection of several mini-projects I have worked on, be it for my own interest/learning or for my graduate coursework at NUS.

Broadly, the projects span the following domains/topics:
- **Chat agents**. Highlight(s) include:
    - Cover letter writer - useful tool for job-seekers, given the current state of the job market. *Note that the cover letters generated here are not the end product, and must be reworked further before submission.
    - Mock-up of agent that answers insurance-related questions with RAG.
- **NLP (text classification & generation)**. Highlight(s) include:
    - Dysfunctional thoughts classifier project - classify dysfunctional thoughts into CBT-based categories
    - Citation type classifier project - classify citations into citation types, as specified by SciCite dataet
    - Stock portfolio helper project (WIP) - recommend stocks to buy or sell everyday. WIP, but currently features a multi-agent workflow for data labelling and a RoBERTa classifier to identify 'relevant' articles
- **Image processing & classification**. Highlight(s) include:
    - Image rectification project, featuring line detection, homography and other image processing techniques
- **Other ML projects** (e.g. stock predictions, implementations of specific algorithms). Highlight(s) include:
    - Classifier that determines how credible/important a statement appears to be (from Kaggle)
