# Personal-Projects
##  Introduction
This repository is a collection of several mini-projects I have worked on, be it for my own interest/learning or for my coursework at NUS.

Broadly, the projects span the following domains/topics:
- Chat agents (incl. RAG)
- NLP (text classification & generation)
- Image processing & classification
- Other ML projects (e.g. stock predictions, implementations of specific algorithms)
